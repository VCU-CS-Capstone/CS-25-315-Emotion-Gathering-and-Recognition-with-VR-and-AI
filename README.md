# *AI Emotion Recognition*
## *VCU College of Engineering*
## *Use AI to detect emotion from photos and video*

The project aims to measure emotions specifically focused on software developers during their meetings. By collecting extensive voice data from developers participating in various collaborative discussions, the project will employ advanced AI techniques and Large Language Models (LLMs) to accurately identify and interpret emotional states. This innovative approach leverages the latest advancements in natural language processing and emotion recognition to provide insights into the emotional dynamics of team interactions, ultimately aiming to enhance productivity, collaboration, and overall mental health in the software development industry.
